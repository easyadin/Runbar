## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- macOS (for development and testing)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/runbar.git
cd runbar

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start development mode
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript code
- `npm run dev` - Start development mode with hot reload
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer explicit return types for public functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use async/await over Promises when possible

### General Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

### File Organization

- One class/interface per file
- Group related functionality in directories
- Use index files for clean exports
- Follow the established directory structure

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ClassName', () => {
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test';
      
      // Act
      const result = method(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.ts
```
